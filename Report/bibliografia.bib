  abstract  = {Successfully uncovering patterns using data mining is an iterative process. Chapter 2 provides a framework to solve the data mining problem. The five-step process outlined in this chapter provides guidelines on gathering subject matter expertise; exploring the data with statistics and visualization; building a model using data mining algorithms; testing the model and deploying it in a production environment; and finally reflecting on new knowledge gained in the cycle. Over the years of evolution of data mining practices, different frameworks for the data mining process have been put forward by various academic and commercial bodies, like the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, knowledge discovery in databases, etc. These data mining frameworks exhibit common characteristics and hence we will be using a generic framework closely resembling the CRISP process.}
