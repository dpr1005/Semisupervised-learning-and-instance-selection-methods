        Implementation of The Condensed Nearest Neighbor Rule

        The first sample of each class is placed in *store*. Thus we only have
        one the second sample classification will be trivial. When a sample is
        classified correctly it is places in *handbag*, otherwise it is placed
        inside *store*. This procedure will be repeated until the nth sample is
        being classified, whether it was correctly or not.
        Once the first loop is finished, it continues looping through *handbag*
        until termination, what will happen if either of these two cases occurs:
        - All the samples have been added to *store*, which means *handbag* is
        empty.
        - One complete pass has been made through *handbag* and none samples
        where transferred to *store*. The following passes will end up with the
        same result as the underlying decision surface has not been changed.
