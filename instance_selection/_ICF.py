    Parameters
    ----------
    nearest_neighbors : int, default=3
        Number to use as nearest neighbors when computing distances.

    power_parameter : int, default=2
        Power parameter for the Minkowski metric. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance (l2)
        for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

        ICF is based on coverage and reachable, due to this two concepts it
        performs deletion of samples based on the rule: "If the reachability
        of a sample is greater than its coverage, that sample has to be
        removed".
        I.e. if another sample of the same class which is nearer than the
        closest enemy is able to provide more information, the sample with
        less coverage than reachable will be removed.
